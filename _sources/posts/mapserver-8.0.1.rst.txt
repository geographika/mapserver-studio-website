MapServer 8.0.0 and focuses on fixes and

The `MapServer Security Policy <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/blob/main/SECURITY.md>`_ contains a good summary of
what release numbers mean. For a version in the format x.y.z:

    x

    Major release series number.
    Major releases indicate substantial changes to the software and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed across series. Current release series is 8

    y

    Minor release series number.
    Minor releases indicate smaller, functional additions or improvements to the software and should be generally backwards compatible within a major release series. Users should be able to confidently upgrade from one minor release to another within the same release series, so from 7.4.x to 7.6.x.

    z

    Point release series number.
    Point releases indicate maintenance releases - usually a combination of bug and security fixes and perhaps small feature additions. 
    Backwards compatibility should be preserved and users should be able to confidently upgrade between point releases 
    within the same release series, so from 7.6.4 to 7.6.5.

OSS-Fuzz is an open source project launched by Google in 2016 that aims to improve the security and stability of 
software by providing continuous fuzz testing to open source software projects. Fuzz testing is a technique where software 
is bombarded with a large number of inputs to identify vulnerabilities and crashes.
