Projections
===========

msProcessProjection(): Projection library error. proj error "Invalid value for an argument" for "init=ESRI:54009" - note this is case-sensitive on Linux
so the file would need to be named ``ESRI``

Starting with PROJ 6, multiple directories can be specified. 
On Unix, they should be separated by the colon (:) character. on Windows, by the semi-colon (;) character.

.. code-block:: bat

    PROJECTION
        "init=esri:54009" # file should be named lower-case
    END
    

MapServer supports both PROJ_LIB abd PROJ_DATA (as of version 8.0)

Are multiple paths supported?
