Leader Lines
============

In cartography, leader lines are lines used to connect labels on a map to their corresponding feature. 
They are commonly used when labels cannot be placed directly on the feature without overlapping other labels.

Leader lines are an important tool in map design as they help to improve the readability and clarity of 
a map by guiding the viewer's eye to the labeled feature or point of interest.

In MapServer leader lines were part of the `6.2 release in 2021 <https://mapserver.org/development/announce/6-2.html#label-leader-offsetting>`_.

label lines to features where space is an issue for the label (callouts)

The `Request for Comment (RFC) <https://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-81.html#rfc81>`_


``LABEL`` leaders are defined at the ``CLASS`` level in their own ``LEADER`` block:

The `LEADER`` block has 3 properties:

+ `GRIDSTEP <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/leader.html#mapfile-leader-gridstep>`_
+ `MAXDISTANCE <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/leader.html#mapfile-leader-maxdistance>`_
+ `STYLE <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/style.html#style>`_

Multiple styles can be applied to the leader line

Collision detection - cannot collide with other leader lines and labels.

"Label leader lines interfere with the label text" - https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/4243


One workaround to this is to put an outlinecolor on your label to minimize (hide) interference with the leader line.


https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/4241 -  Support for symbols at start or end of leader lines #4241
My goal was to put a symbol at the start or end of the leader, but as Thomas has indicated it is not supported yet.
