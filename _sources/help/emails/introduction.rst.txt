Hi all,

Thank you for signing up to receive news about MapServer Studio!

I'm pleased to announce that the beta release is now available for testing at https://app.mapserverstudio.net. 
MapServer Studio provides a user-friendly platform for both new and experienced users to edit and view MapServer Mapfiles.

To get started with MapServer Studio, simply sign up for a free account, which will allow you to save your maps. 
If you're looking for even more advanced features, consider the paid account, which removes image watermarks and will offer additional benefits
in future releases. Please have a look at our minimal quickstart guide at https://mapserverstudio.net/help/quickstart.html.

Natural Earth datasets can be used within MapServer Studio, and the collection can be browsed at https://api.mapserverstudio.net/mapserver/naturalearth/ogcapi/collections?f=html.
In addition, you can easily load datasets from any publicly available S3 bucket.

Please get in touch if you have any questions or find any bugs, and thanks for your support.

Seth
