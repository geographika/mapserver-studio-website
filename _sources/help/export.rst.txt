Map Exports
===========

MapServer Studio allows the map image in the viewer to be exported to different formats. These can be selected by
clicking the "Export" button and selecting the output format:

.. image:: ../images/help/export.png
  :alt: The Export button in MapServer Studio
  :align: center

For the image formats (including SVG) the image will open in a new browser tab. You can then right-click on the image to save it to disk.

.. image:: ../images/help/export_images.png
  :alt: Right-click the image to save
  :scale: 80%
  :align: center

PDF files will download the PDF directly when selected. The downloaded file name will be something like ``download (1)`` without an
extension. You may have to rename this to ``download (1).pdf`` to open the file in a PDF reader or browser. 

Currently the following output formats are supported: ``PNG``, ``JPEG``, ``SVG``, and ``PDF``. 

Details on the output format configurations can be seen in the MapServer `OUTPUTFORMAT <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/outputformat.html>`_
documentation. Please get in touch at support@mapserverstudio.net if you require additional output formats to be added to the user interface, 
or made available within MapServer Studio.

    Need to workout how to set the size too before adding text below

    To increase the resolution of an image you can set the `RESOLUTION <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/map.html#resolution-parameter>`_ parameter
    in your Mapfile. This setting is in pixels per inch The default value is 72. The minimum is 10 and the maximum that can be set is 1000.

    .. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
        NAME "Example"
        RESOLUTION 1000

    Note if you change the resolution in your Mapfile you will need to click "Serve" to generate the new output again as exports are based on the
    map in the viewer.
