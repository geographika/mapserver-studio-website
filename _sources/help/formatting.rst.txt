Formatting Mapfiles
===================

With MapServer Studio, you can easily format your Mapfiles. Simply click the "Format" button on the toolbar to automatically format your file. 
By default, this also checks for any syntax errors in your Mapfile.

You can customise the formatting options by clicking the "Settings" button and accessing the "Settings" dialog.

    You can leave the Settings options screen open and continue to click the Format button to reformat your Mapfile using various options.

Formatting options are detailed below. Formatting is powered using `mappyfile <https://mappyfile.readthedocs.io>`_ - please 
see the `Pretty Printing <https://mappyfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pretty_printing.html>`_ documentation for further details.

Indent Level
------------

This setting allows you to indent your Mapfile blocks by either 2 or 4 spaces.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  # indentation set to 2
  LAYER
    NAME "countries"
    TYPE POLYGON
    ...
    CLASS
      STYLE
        COLOR 60 179 113
        OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
        OUTLINEWIDTH 0.1
      END
    END
  END

  # indentation set to 4
    LAYER
        NAME "countries"
        TYPE POLYGON
        ...
        CLASS
            STYLE
                COLOR 60 179 113
                OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
                OUTLINEWIDTH 0.1
            END
        END
    END

Quote
-----

You can choose to use either single or double quotes for values in your Mapfile. 
This is a personal preference, as both quote types work the same way.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    # double quotes
    LAYER
        NAME "countries"
        CONNECTION "/data/naturalearth/fgb"
        DATA "ne_10m_admin_0_countries"
        PROCESSING "CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER"
        PROJECTION
            "init=epsg:4326"
        END
        ...

    # single quotes
    LAYER
        NAME 'countries'
        CONNECTION '/data/naturalearth/fgb'
        DATA 'ne_10m_admin_0_countries'
        PROCESSING 'CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER'
        PROJECTION
            'init=epsg:4326'
        END
        ...

Add Closing Block Comments
--------------------------

This option adds each block's name as a comment next to its corresponding ``END`` keyword. This can be useful when editing large Mapfiles
which can have several ``END`` tags grouped together.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "countries"
        TYPE POLYGON
        PROJECTION
            "init=epsg:4326"
        END # PROJECTION
        ...
        CLASS
            STYLE
                COLOR 60 179 113
                OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
                OUTLINEWIDTH 0.1
            # note the following END keywords are now annotated
            END # STYLE
        END # CLASS
    END # LAYER

Align Key Values in Block
-------------------------

This option vertically aligns keys and values within each block, improving the readability of your Mapfiles.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        # the following values are all aligned vertically
        NAME            "countries"
        TYPE            POLYGON
        STATUS          ON
        CONNECTIONTYPE  OGR
        CONNECTION      "/data/naturalearth/fgb"
        DATA            "ne_10m_admin_0_countries"
        EXTENT          -180.0 -90.0 180.0 90
        PROCESSING      "CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER"
        CLASS
            STYLE
                COLOR           60 179 113
                OUTLINECOLOR    255 255 255
                OUTLINEWIDTH    0.1
            END
        END
    END

Move Complex Types to the End of a Block
----------------------------------------

This option moves any Mapfile objects to the bottom of its parent, leaving simple key value pairs at the top of a block.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        # simple key, value pairs are moved to the top of the block
        NAME "cities"
        TYPE POINT
        STATUS ON
        CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
        CONNECTION "/data/naturalearth/fgb"
        DATA "SELECT *, 15-LABELRANK AS POINTSIZE FROM ne_110m_populated_places"
        EXTENT -180.0 -90.0 180.0 90
        # PROJECTION and CLASS have nested properties so are moved to the
        # bottom of the LAYER block
        PROJECTION
            "init=epsg:4326"
        END
        CLASS
            EXPRESSION ( [WORLDCITY] = 1 )
            STYLE
                SYMBOL "circlef"
                COLOR "#6A5ACD"
                SIZE [POINTSIZE]
            END
        END
    END

Keep Mapfile Comments
---------------------

This option keeps any Mapfile comments when reformatting a Mapfile. By default this option is set to ``ON``
to avoid losing comments when clicking the Format button. Sometimes it is useful to strip all comments from a Mapfile, 
for example when deploying to production.

.. note::

    Please note that this feature is experimental, and the position of comments in your Mapfile 
    may change when reformatted. This could result in some comments being lost in certain cases.



..
    The following statement only works if a user has made an edit..
    If you want to revert formatting changes you can right click in the Mapfile editor and select Undo, or press CTRL+Z to revert the changes.
