Editing Mapfiles
================

MapServer Studio uses `Ace <https://ace.c9.io/>`_ a high performance code editor for the web. The editor
is customised for working with Mapfiles, with the features listed below.

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

The editor is configured to use highlighting for the Mapfile syntax. Keywords and Mapfile properties will be displayed
in different colours.

Undo and Redo

The File menu contains an Undo and a Redo button to help with editing Mapfiles.

The Shortcut keys CTRL+U for **Undo** and CTRL+SHIFT+Z for **Redo** can also be used. 

Code Folding
------------

The editor comes equipped with a code folding feature, allowing you to collapse Mapfile blocks like 
``LAYER....END``. This can be useful to hide sections of large Mapfiles to concentrate on specific blocks.
