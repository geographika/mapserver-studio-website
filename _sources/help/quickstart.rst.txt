Quick Start
-----------

The easiest way to get familiar with MapServer Studio is to open a template map ans start playing around with the
Mapfile syntax. The official MapServer documentation for `<https://mapserver.org/mapfile/> Mapfiles`_ is an excellent resource. 

The <https://mapserver.org/introduction.html#introduction-to-the-mapfile>Introduction to the Mapfile`_ provides a good introduction.
