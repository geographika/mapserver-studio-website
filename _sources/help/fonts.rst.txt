Fonts
=====

MapServer Studio allows you to choose from thousands of different fonts to use in your maps.

To use a font first set the `FONTSET <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/fontset.html#fontset>`_ in your Mapfile.
A ``FONTSET`` is a text file that contains a font name and its associated TrueType file. TrueType fonts can be rendered at any size 
without losing quality. 

MapServer Studio currently supports two ``FONTSET`` values: **google** and **microsoft**. These values can be
added to a Mapfile to allow fonts from either of these collections to be used:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
        NAME "MyFontsMap"
        FONTSET "google"
        ...

Selecting a Font
----------------

Once a ``FONTSET`` has been selected any of the fonts in the collection can be used when rendering a map.
Fonts are typically used in a `LABEL <https://mapserver.org/mapfile/label.html>`_ object. 

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LABEL
      COLOR  150 150 150
      FONT "arial"
      TYPE truetype
      SIZE 12
    END

.. note:: 

    Aliases are **not** case-sensitive so "Arial", "arial", and "ARIAL" can all be used. MapServer Studio also
    allows for aliases with spaces or hyphens e.g. "Times New Roman Italic" or "Times-New-Roman-Italic"
    are equivalent.

Below is an example of a label using the `Monsieur La Doulaise <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Monsieur+La+Doulaise>`_ font from the
Google fontset. You can play with the `online example here <https://app.mapserverstudio.net/kQex4CBd>`_.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
        NAME "Caribbean"
        FONTSET "google"
    ..
        LABEL
            FONT "Monsieur La Doulaise" # can also use "Monsieur-La-Doulaise"
            TYPE TRUETYPE
            SIZE 28
            POSITION AUTO
            PARTIALS FALSE
            BUFFER 5
        END

.. image:: ../images/help/font1.png

With a change of font and just a couple of changes to the labels and the map colour you can create a very
different looking map. You can play with the `online example here < https://app.mapserverstudio.net/d8dQZxIY>`_.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
        NAME "Scifi"
        FONTSET "google"
    ..
            LABEL
            FONT "Bruno Ace" # can also use "Bruno-Ace"
            TYPE TRUETYPE
            SIZE 14
            COLOR 255 255 255
            POSITION AUTO
            PARTIALS FALSE
            BUFFER 5
        END

.. image:: ../images/help/font2.png

Using Fontsets Locally
----------------------

If you have created a Mapfile using MapServer Studio, and want to host the Mapfile elsewhere you will need to
obtain copies of the TTF files used in your map and then create a fontset file containing any of the fonts used in your map.
For example create a ``fonts.txt`` with the following entries:

.. code-block:: bat

    Bruno-Ace                                          BrunoAce-Regular.ttf
    Monsieur-La-Doulaise                               MonsieurLaDoulaise-Regular.ttf

You will then need to reference this file in your Mapfile:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    FONTSET "../path/fonts.txt"

Aliases cannot contain spaces (see `this issue <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/1908>`_), so a workaround
is to replace these with hyphens. The paths to the TTF files are relative to the ``fonts.txt`` file. 

Google Fonts
------------

`Google Fonts <https://fonts.google.com/>`_ is a collection of open-source fonts that can be used by anyone for free. 
From the `FAQ <https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq>`_:

    *all Google Fonts are open source and are without cost...you can use them commercially, and 
    even include them within a product that is sold commercially.*

There are over 3,350 fonts in the collection. To find a font browse or search the fonts at https://fonts.google.com/. 
Then simply use the name of the font as the
``FONT`` value in your Mapfile. There are 

Microsoft Fonts
---------------

This fontset contains fonts from `Microsoft True Type Core Fonts for the Web <https://packages.debian.org/sid/ttf-mscorefonts-installer>`_.
These can be installed on a Linux machine using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

The `End User License Agreement <https://corefonts.sourceforge.net/eula.htm>`_ does not restrict using the fonts when generating a map.

Below is the full list of available fonts in this fontset:
